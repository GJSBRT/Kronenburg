One very exploitable server-sided event: 'esx_kekke_tackle:tryTackle' which could be manipulated and used by modders to tackle an entire server full of players all at once has been fully patched and protected by adding a police job check for players who attempt to trigger this event as well as a distance check from the source player to the target player to further verify legitness.

Minor client-sided changes and optimization.
